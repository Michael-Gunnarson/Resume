So there are a few things that need to be done:
find r vector
    -perifocal to xyz coord sys
        -vector maths
create lambert solver
    -lots of something
    -using r and v at end to find vector components of e and H,
     resulting in solivng for inclination, LAAN, etc.
transfer flyby material
transfer SOI material
create database of planets, gravity, and orbital parameters
use lambert to create general solver
figure out how tf to create a cycler orbit

once that is done:
interface cpp with python for speed
create python functions for large units of orbit solivng
figure out how to implement into GMAT

Come up with better names for the orbit segments
