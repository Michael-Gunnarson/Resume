This is a work in progress project, attempting to create a simple and lightweight tool to calculate orbital trajectories.  The plans for this project include:

* implementing basic flyby maneuvers in 3 dimensions
* working out test cases with solutions by hand
* compiling project as a library to interface with python scripts, allowing speed of C++ and flexibility of python
* use existing NASA GMAT/python 3 interface to calculate rough solutions between points
* use GMAT and VF13ad to optimize fuel effiiency in mission design to Comet 46P/Wirtanen

This roadmap seems feasible and reasonable, given enough time.  This project exists for two reasons.  First: this is me fulfilling a promise to Adam Zufall that I would finish designing a tool for future classes to use.  Second, if accepted, these calculations will be part of a paper written for SciTech in early 2024 based off of UC Davis' COW-1 mission design.
