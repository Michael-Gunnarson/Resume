# Resume
This repository is a collection of projects I completed at UC Davis for my Aerospace Science and Engineering degree.
You will find projects in Python, Matlab, R, C++, and Arduino.  I love coding and enjoy using it as a tool
to help solve engineering problems.  

If you find my work compelling, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-gunnarson-966aa321a/ 
I'm currently looking for work near Seattle Washington in Navigation/Trajectory Design, GNC, or even Software Design relating to spacecraft.  
I hope to hear from you!
